# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction

This problem is about loan defaulters prediction. For this, I have used [Lending Club Loan Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/home) avaiable on Kaggle. Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending platform.

The dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. Dataset is highly skewed with around 900K rows and 74 columns. Using necessary data, I have developed a machine learning model to predict loan defaulter.

I have divided this project into two parts.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning:
  - Included in 'Data_Cleaning.ipynb' 
  - Done following cleaning operations:
      * Selecting relevant features
      * Null value imputation
      * Creating dummy variables
      * Handling outliers
      * Multicolinearity Check
    
2. Training a machine learning model:
