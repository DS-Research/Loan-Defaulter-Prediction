# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction

Lending Club is a US based peer-to-peer lending platform. Lending Club has made some of its data public on Kaggle ([Lending Club Loan Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/home)). The dataset contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. Dataset is highly skewed with around 900K rows and 74 columns.

My aim to is to predict whether a person will be able to repay loan or not. This will help the financial institution to decide whether to sanction the loan or not.

I have divided this project into two parts.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning:
  - Included in 'Data_Cleaning.ipynb' 
  - Done following cleaning operations:
      * Selecting relevant features
      * Null value imputation
      * Creating dummy variables
      * Handling outliers
      * Multicolinearity Check
    
2. Training a machine learning model:
